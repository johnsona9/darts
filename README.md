# Darts

## The purpose for this project is to build a RoR app that helps you keep score while playing darts.

This is a basic RoR app that allows users to play darts. Currently only two player cricket is supported but more games are being added with up to four players.

The intention is to have this app run on a raspberry-pi and act as a scoreboard with a touchscreen monitor.
